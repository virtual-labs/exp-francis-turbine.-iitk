### About the Experiment 

The Francis turbine is a type of mixed flow reaction turbine that was developed by James B. Francis. This turbine is used for medium heads ranging from 40 m to 600 m with medium discharge. Water enters the runner and flows towards the center of the wheel in the radial direction and leaves parallel to the axis of the turbine. Francis turbines are the most common water turbine in use today and are primarily used for electrical power production. The power output which generally for Francis turbine ranges from just a few kilowatts up to 800 MW.
When Francis turbine is not properly designed, a detrimental phenomenon called Cavitation can occur which can be catastrophic in nature. The cavitation problem is produced by bubbles of vapor when the pressure of the liquid is lower than the vapor pressure. This produces erosion in the moving part of the turbineâ€™s runner and shaft.
